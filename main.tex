\section{Introduction}
The rapid development of wireless communication and artificial intelligence (AI) technology is propelling a new generation of smart infrastructure and connected systems. Among the most groundbreaking AI technologies are the Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated unprecedented capability in understanding, generating, and interacting with human language. Meanwhile, the subsequent generation sixth generation (6G) of mobile networks will provide unprecedented speed, extremely low latency, and pervasive connectivity to enable an amazingly broad set of applications in smart cities, autonomous systems, and more. This report explores the intersection of these two promising fields—LLMs and 6G networks—explaining their respective innovations and the mind-bending potential they share in combination. By discussing how LLMs can complement various fields of 6G, ranging from smart automation to personalized services, this report aims to provide insights into the future of intelligent communications and challenges to be overcome for it to become a reality.

\section{Background}
	\subsection{What Are Large Language Models?}
	Large Language Models are a form of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human language. Primarily based on transformer architectures, LLMs are trained on vast amounts of textual data to learn patterns, meaning, and context. They are capable of performing a variety of natural language processing activities such as translation, summary, question-answering, and generation of text. OpenAI’s GPT, Google’s BERT, and Meta’s LLaMA are few examples of established LLMs. LLMs' versatility lies in being able to generalize from training data when generating coherent as well as contextually relevant responses across a broad spectrum of topics. Their scalability has been able to make them useful tools not only in language applications but also in coding generation, scientific analysis, as well as making decisions. They also pose issues such as high computational needs, potential biases, as well as enormous data required to train them.

	\subsection{What Is 6G?}
	The 6G, a sixth generation of wireless technology, has been envisioned to replace 5G by 2030s. 6G has not yet initiated its development so far, but its objectives are data rates higher than 1 Tbps, near-microsecond latency, and ultra-massive network capacity. In contrast to its predecessors, 6G would focus on supporting immersive applications such as holographic communication, real-time digital twins, and ubiquitous artificial intelligence. Terahertz communication, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), next-generation MIMO systems, and inherent integration of AI throughout the entire network structure are a few of the salient technologies envisioned in 6G. Apart from technology development, 6G also focuses on enhancing sustainability, energy efficiency, and worldwide coverage through the assistance of non-territorial networks such as satellites in low-earth orbits. 6G is not merely a speed and connectivity increment today but a fundamental infrastructure for smart and adaptable digital environments.
