\section{Introduction}
The rapid development of wireless communication and artificial intelligence (AI) technology is propelling a new generation of smart infrastructure and connected systems. Among the most groundbreaking AI technologies are the Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated unprecedented capability in understanding, generating, and interacting with human language. Meanwhile, the subsequent generation sixth generation (6G) of mobile networks will provide unprecedented speed, extremely low latency, and pervasive connectivity to enable an amazingly broad set of applications in smart cities, autonomous systems, and more. This report explores the intersection of these two promising fields—LLMs and 6G networks—explaining their respective innovations and the mind-bending potential they share in combination. By discussing how LLMs can complement various fields of 6G, ranging from smart automation to personalized services, this report aims to provide insights into the future of intelligent communications and challenges to be overcome for it to become a reality.
