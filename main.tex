\begin{abstract}
    This report explores the potential integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the development and enhancement of 6G networks. As 6G technologies aim to revolutionize global connectivity, LLMs, with their advanced processing and understanding of human language, could offer significant advantages in areas such as network optimization, communication protocols, and AI-driven automation. This report investigates the key aspects of LLMs, their capabilities, and the synergistic potential when paired with 6G. Furthermore, challenges and future opportunities are discussed, providing insight into the evolving landscape of these technologies.
